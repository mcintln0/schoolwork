Each branch contains code from my classes at University as an example of what I can do with code. 

In the highlights folder are some of my favorite coding projects. Some of them are more in depth than others, and some reflect my passions outside of programming.
In this doc I will briefly talk about why each of the docs were uploaded.
------------------------------------------------

FilledTri (Java OOP) - The objectdraw library we used for my intro into computer science class didn't have a triangle class and I wanted to use triangles so I made one in my free time. The class makes equilateral triangles where you click once given the appropiate information.

Maze (Java OOP) - One of the challenges for class was to create a maze. I was the only student able to figure out how to visualize a maze, and make the program interactive to a degree. This was really fun figuring out how to make the maze "solve itself". The mazes are created by reading text input based on the cardinal directions.

Game and Player 2 (Processing) - For our final project in CS276 we had to make a game, and it was my first time using processing to interact with another computer. We had tested the program for one or two lessons but seeing it come to life (even with a few errors) was an awesome experience.

midiSound (Processing) - We did music based projects in class, but we hadn't learned how to get a midi to interact with Processing. So this project was based on me looking up an additional library to import and learning how to read the information in order to use my maschine (drum machine) to interact with my program. One of the programs that I had tons of fun coding and nicely intergrated my love of music and computer science.

It's Lit (Java)  - My final project that highlighted the lighting issues on campus and the resulting saftey concerns. One of the only projects I had that directly impacted campus and allowed me to use coding to highlight a saftey concern. Working on this project took almost a year, and led to cross department interactions with deans, the provost, and facilities management. This is the project that let me know I could use computer science to impact real change, and reminded me that even with the code being able to talk to many different people was a necessary skill.
