Purpose: Converting from sound files to image files


**** Directions *****

Run the file by selecting a soundfile to convert to an image.

Accepted sound files include:
	.wav
	.aiff/.aif
	.mp3


Note: Large sound files over 2 minutes will cause the app to run slower
and the full sound will not be converted into an image


To get a 640 by 480 image, map a sound file of exactly 6.9659863 seconds.

If you map a 90 second sound file, the image will be 1995 x 1995 pixels.


**** Image to Sound Playback ****

There will be additional feedback to the image produced sound

In the mousePressed Function:

If converting from an MP3 use 2 for the play function
If converting from an WAV use 0.5 for the play function
